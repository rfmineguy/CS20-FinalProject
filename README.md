# CS20 Final Project
## Description
This repository host my final project for the CS20 class. It is a terminal based game that relies on the amazing terminal graphics library `FTXUI`. <br>
The game is card based, and you are essentially in a turn based two player battle. There are a few card types that perform different actions. <br> 
For example the Sword attack is a simple damage attack, the poison is another damage attack, and the health card is for healing yourself. <br>
